Calculator
==========

This is a Project for UMUC CMSC 495

This is a simple calculator that allows a user to use basic arithmetic.
The calculator will keep a running tab with line numbers.
When the equals button is pressed. That tabulation is complete. A user may save or discard that tabultion. Any saved tabulations may be reloaded for review or line item changes. 
A comment by line feature will be included - only lines with operands will be available for comment.
